## General Folder Structure

> The general structure and organization of this repository are geared towards getting coding work off the ground quickly. In a pinch, though, it can also be used to set up writing and multimedia projects. See the general structure with links below. For obvious reasons, the outline does not contain links to REMOVE-THIS.txt files.

- [code/][dir-1]
    - REMOVE-THIS.txt
- [docs/][dir-2]
    - [content/][dir-3]
        - REMOVE-THIS.txt
    - [examples/][dir-4]
        - REMOVE-THIS.txt
    - [research/][dir-5]
        - REMOVE-THIS.txt
    - [CONTRIBUTING.md][doc-4]
    - [ORGANIZATION.md][doc-6]
    - [STYLE.md][doc-5]

## File And Folder Descriptions

> Each file and folder provided has a general purpose. While those files and folders can be moved, removed, or repurposed, keeping the majority of the structure intact will make it easier to create and adhere to a standard.

### REMOVE-THIS.txt Files

> REMOVE-THIS files do nothing. They are placeholders designed to ensure that folders exist.

### /code/

> The root code folder is where source code goes. It can also be used to store projects for documentation.

### /docs/

> The root docs folder is where the bulk of repository documentation goes. A few exceptions to the rule are the CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, and README files that need to be in the root folder for GitHub purposes. Use the docs folder for more extensive documentation projects.

### /docs/content/

> The docs content folder is where more substantial documentation efforts go. If certain concepts require a better explanation, then MD files should be placed here with additional sub-folders and files as needed.

### /docs/examples/

> The docs examples folder is where documentation examples go. Most will be inline, but some require more in-depth explanations and pre-setup. For those examples, MD files should be placed here with additional sub-folders and files as needed.

### /docs/research/

> The docs research folder is where documentation research goes. Researching concepts does not always fit neatly into documentation efforts. Some researching efforts do not necessarily lead to meaningful changes or updates for the project. For those research efforts, MD files should be placed here with additional sub-folders and files as needed.

### /docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

> The contributing document specifies how a person can get started with modifying the repository. It also explains the process of accepting or rejecting changes.

### /docs/ORGANIZATION.md

> The organization document is this document. It explains the purposes of the main files and folders to be used in the repository.

### /docs/STYLE.md

> The style document describes how efforts are to be formatted and provides a way to maintain consistency within efforts.

### /resources/

> The root resources folder is storage for media used in documentation efforts.

### /resources/default-01-thumb.jpg

> The image file default-01-thumb is the thumbnail of the first default image.

### /resources/default-01.jpg

> The image file default-01 is the first default image.

### /resources/default-02-thumb.jpg

> The image file default-02-thumb is the thumbnail of the second default image.

### /resources/default-02.jpg

> The image file default-02 is the second default image.

### /scripts/

> The root scripts folder is for setup, cleanup, or other miscellaneous scripts outside the primary code efforts. It can also be used to store scripts for documentation.

### /tests/

> The root tests folder is where tests go. It can also be used to store tests for documentation.

### /CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

> The code of conduct specifies how project collaborators should treat each other. It includes the social responsibilities of the parties involved.

### /LICENSE

> The license document describes how to handle the copyright of the material.

### /README.md

> The readme document is used to describe the repository in general terms and to provide enough information to help a would-be contributor get started.
